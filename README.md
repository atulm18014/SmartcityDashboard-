# Smart City Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Dashboard

## Problem Statement

As cities grow, **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions** increase due to industrial activities, traffic congestion, and high energy consumption. These emissions drive climate change, impacting urban environments with rising temperatures, poor air quality, and increased vulnerability to extreme weather. With cities contributing over **70% of global GHG emissions**, addressing them is essential to creating sustainable cities and meeting global climate goals, such as the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target.

Total Emissions: Annually, over 36 billion metric tons of CO2 are released, primarily from fossil fuels, industrial processes, and land-use changes.
Major Contributors: China, the U.S., and the EU are the top emitters, with China accounting for about 28% of global emissions.
Trends: Global CO2 emissions have risen gradually due to industrialization, population growth, and increasing energy consumption, despite efforts to reduce them.
## CO2 Emissions in India
Total Emissions: India is the third-largest emitter, contributing around 7% of global emissions (over 2.5 billion metric tons annually).
Sector Breakdown: The energy sector, particularly coal-fired plants, is the main source, followed by transportation, agriculture, and industry.
Growth Rate: Emissions are rising due to rapid urbanization and economic growth, highlighting the need for effective reduction policies.
